## About

The **Video Notation Schema** is a comprehensive JSON Schema (Draft¬†2020‚Äë12) that defines a structured prompt format for programmatic video creation with Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) models. It enables creators, prompt engineers, and developers to articulate their creative intent with exceptional precision, from global video attributes to shot‚Äëby‚Äëshot instructions, character profiles, camera controls, audio elements, and reusable components such as props, subjects, motion graphics, lighting, and tone presets.

## üìÑ¬†Schema Structure

The root object is organised into the following top‚Äëlevel sections:

| Section                                                                                                                                | Purpose                                                                           |

| `characters`                                                                                                                           | Reusable character definitions.                                                   |
| `global_props`, `global_audio_elements`, `global_subjects`, `global_motion_graphics`, `global_lighting_presets`, `global_tone_presets` | Reusable definitions for common elements.                                         |
| `global_style`                                                                                                                         | Overarching stylistic directives for the entire video.                            |
| `scenes`                                                                                                                               | An array of individual scenes, each with its own specific settings and overrides. |

## Why this schema?

As AI video‚Äëgeneration models grow ever more sophisticated, the need for precise and consistent creative control has become paramount. Regular text prompts, whilst flexible, often lack the structure required for complex, multi‚Äëscene narratives, detailed cinematic instructions, or the consistent application of stylistic elements across an entire film. They may also introduce unnecessary tokens, resulting in token inefficiency.

The **Video¬†Notation¬†Schema** addresses these challenges by providing:

- **Granular control** ‚Äì Move beyond simple text prompts to define every facet of a production, from camera angles and lighting to character emotions and scene transitions.
- **Consistency & scalability** ‚Äì Ensure stylistic coherence across multiple scenes and characters, making larger projects easier to manage and iterate.
- **Interoperability** ‚Äì Offer a standardised, machine‚Äëreadable format adoptable by any AI video model or tool, fostering an open and collaborative ecosystem.
- **Reduced ambiguity** ‚Äì Minimise misinterpretations by the AI, leading to more predictable, higher‚Äëquality outputs that match the creator‚Äôs vision.
- **Enhanced workflows** ‚Äì Streamline prompting for individuals and teams, enabling efficient iteration and faster delivery.
- **Versionability** ‚Äì JSON prompts integrate seamlessly with version‚Äëcontrol systems such as Git, allowing transparent tracking of changes, collaborative review, and simple roll‚Äëbacks.

In essence, the schema translates abstract creative concepts into concrete, actionable instructions for AI, unlocking new possibilities for storytelling and visual communication.

## üöÄ¬†Getting Started

### 1. Use Video¬†Notation¬†Studio 

Our web‚Äëbased **Video Notation Studio** provides a guided interface with validation, real-time visualisation, and the ability to export your completed JSON prompt. 
The Studio is fully browser-based and uses local storage only ‚Äî your work is saved privately in your browser and never uploaded or shared.

#### Studio Screenshot

### 2. Edit JSON manually with schema‚Äëaware tooling

Install a JSON Schema aware editor or plugin (e.g. Visual Studio¬†Code with the **YAML** or **JSON¬†Schema** extension). Add a `$schema` key to the top of your file to enable validation and autocompletion.

**Prompt ‚Äì minimal example:**

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://schemas.video-notation.com/video-notation.schema@v1.0.0",
  "metadata": {
    "title": "My First AI Video",
    "duration_seconds": 30,
    "video_type": "explainer",
    "aspect_ratio": "16:9",
    "frame_rate": "30fps",
    "resolution": "1080p",
    "colour_grading": "natural",
    "language": "en-GB"
  },
  "characters": [],
  "global_style": {},
  "scenes": [],
  "annotations": {}
}
```
